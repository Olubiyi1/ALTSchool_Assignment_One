      <h2>Why I Joined the ALT School Program</h2>
      <p>
        I joined ALT School to gain structured and hands-on training in backend
        development. Learning on my own was becoming difficult, so I wanted a
        program that could guide me, support me, and give me access to a
        community of learners and mentors.

      <h2>My Goals for the School of Engineering Program</h2>
      <p>
        My main goals are to become confident in backend development, master
        tools like Node.js and TypeScript, build real-world projects, and be
        ready for internship or job opportunities. I also want to grow my
        network and learn how to work on a team.
